# Movie Recommendation System

A **fully working** movie recommendation system built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
This project uses a simple **content-based** approach (via genres) to recommend movies.

## Features

1. **Genre-Based Similarity**  
   Uses the cosine similarity of dummy-encoded genres to find similar movies.
2. **Interactive Streamlit UI**  
   - Select a movie from a dropdown
   - Choose how many recommendations to see
   - See recommended titles in a table
3. **Sample Dataset**  
   - `data/movies.csv` included (8 sample movies)
   - Feel free to add or remove rows
